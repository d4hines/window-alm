# Module: Monitors

## Overview

There are one or more monitors, corresponding to the physical screens connected
to the device running Finsemble, which are rectangular views into the desktop.
Monitors range in size from 800x600 to 4096x2160 (though in the future, they may
grow larger). Typical Finsemble users use between 1 and 9 monitors in a given session.
