# Overview

Finsemble is a desktop software system for connecting many disparate applications into a
single cohesive workﬂow. Finsemble integrates applications in two ways: visually, through
advanced window management capabilities; and logically, through BPM-like workﬂows achieved
via inter-process communication. We focus here on only the visual integrations,
i.e, window management.

This book is a literate [ALM](https://arxiv.org/abs/1505.05022) program. Each page presents
an ALM module describing some feature of window management. The modules are intended to be read linearly, and
later modules build on previous modules.
